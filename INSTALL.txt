Ubuntu Linux:
For OpenGL you will need to do:
  apt-get install freeglut3
You can then install all required Python packages by doing:
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
You will also need to install adb:
  apt-get install android-tools-adb


Windows:
  The requirements.txt file will work for for everything but OpenGL.
  As of 2018 the PyOpenGL and PyOpenGL_accelerate packages in PyPI were not good.
  Instead, download the whl files for both of these for your Python version from
     https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyopengl
  and use pip to install them.
  If you are using an Android device or a Kindle Fire to run the Cozmo app, you
  will also need to install adb. Follow the instructions on this page:
      http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/adb.html
  If you are using an iOS device to run the Cozmo app you must install iTunes on
  your Windows computer so that you get the proper device drivers. Make sure
  that iTunes can talk to your iOS device before proceeding.


MacOS (should be 10.13 or higher):
  The requirements.txt file will work for for everything but PyAudio.
  The version of PyAudio in PyPI does not compile unless you have
  certain tools installed.  Visit this page to learn how to install PyAudio:

  To use OpenGL you need to install freeglut, which can be done with the
  command 'brew install freeglut'. If your system doesn't have the "brew"
  command, visit this page: https://brew.sh/
  If you are using an Android device to run the Cozmo app, you will need to
  install adb. Follow the instructions on this page:
    http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/adb.html
  If you are using an iOS device to run the Cozmo app you don't need to
  install anything extra on your MacOS system.
